# CommonLit-Grading
The goal of this project is to assess the quality of summaries written by students in grades 3-12. Build a model that evaluates how well a student represents the main idea and details of a source text, as well as the clarity, precision, and fluency of the language used in the summary.Got have access to a collection of real student summaries to train our model.
